Spectra App â€” Patch Log (append-only)
===============================


- v1.1.5a: Refactored Streamlit UI with overlay/differential/archive tabs, similarity ribbon, and provider-backed archive workflows.
- v1.1.5b: Normalised ingestion to SI units, added CSV/TXT/FITS upload pipeline with provenance logging, dual-axis overlay plotting, enriched export manifest/metadata presentation, and rebuilt the Atlas documentation for in-app delivery.
- v1.1.5c: Migrated UI tables/plots to Streamlit's `width` API, aliased duplicate similarity labels to avoid Arrow failures, and restored missing `wavelength_m` data during overlay plotting for legacy payloads.
- v1.1.5d: Restored missing imports for the export manifest and duplicate ledger, refreshed the Docs tab to surface the Spectra Atlas with rendered markdown, and hardened provenance exports to retain timestamps.
- v1.1.5e: Fixed ingestion resolution estimates to avoid divide-by-zero masking errors and refreshed continuity metadata for the upload/provenance pipeline.
