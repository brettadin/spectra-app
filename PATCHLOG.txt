Spectra App â€” Patch Log (append-only)
===============================

- v1.1.8 (REF 1.1.8-A01): switch UI timestamps to timezone-aware UTC output, normalise FITS flux unit parsing to silence UnitsWarning spam, and refresh the continuity collateral for the release.
- v1.1.9: fix overlay button keys, respect ledger lock session state, wire the ingest queue into the overlay pipeline, reject metadata-like uploads, and refresh docs for the release.
- v1.1.9: fix overlay button keys, respect ledger lock session state, wire the ingest queue into the overlay pipeline, and refresh docs for the release.
- v1.2.0 (REF 1.2.0-A01 / 1.2.0-C01): patched FITS table ingestion to drop non-positive wavenumber samples safely, documented the runtime package set, and rolled continuity collateral for the release.
- v1.2.0a (REF 1.2.0-A02 / 1.2.0-D01): normalised Angstrom aliases in FITS ingestion, extended regression coverage, and refreshed continuity docs for the hotfix.
- v1.2.0b (REF 1.2.0b-A01 / 1.2.0b-D01): taught FITS table ingestion to recognise time-series axes, updated overlay/metadata UX to label time units, refreshed regression coverage, and rolled continuity docs for the release.
- v1.2.0c (REF 1.2.0c-A01): fixed the example browser provider selector to respect session persistence without triggering Streamlit widget warnings, refreshed UI docs, and logged the QA verification.
- v1.2.0d (REF 1.2.0d-A01): wired the Docs tab banner to current patch metadata so release summaries track `app/version.json`, added regression coverage, and refreshed continuity collateral.
- v1.2.0e (REF 1.2.0e-A01): align the app header caption with active patch metadata and extend UI coverage to prevent regressions.
- v1.2.0f (REF 1.2.0f-A01): normalise example browser provider defaults before the multiselect renders, silencing rerun warnings and preserving cached filters.
- v1.2.0g (REF 1.2.0g-A01): relocate the NIST line catalog tools into the sidebar controls, refresh the library copy, and add regression coverage for the new placement.
- v1.2.0h (REF 1.2.0h-A01): move the example quick-add controls into the sidebar stack, streamline the Library tab messaging, update the UI contract, and extend regression coverage.
- v1.2.0i (REF 1.2.0i-A01): relocate the reference trace selector and clear overlays action to the Differential tab, update regression coverage, and refresh continuity collateral.
- v1.2.0j (REF 1.2.0j-A01): move similarity analysis into the Differential workspace, extend regression coverage, keep overlay metadata/line tables intact, and refresh continuity docs.
- v1.2.0k (REF 1.2.0k-A01): reorganize the target catalog with search filters, manifest metrics, grouped overlay actions, and new layout regression coverage.
- v1.2.0l (REF 1.2.0l-A01): split overlay viewports by axis kind, surface mixed-axis warnings, update exports/tests, and refresh continuity docs.
- v1.2.0m (REF 1.2.0m-A01): relocate the overlay clearing control into the display sidebar cluster, confirm the action in the overlay tab, extend UI coverage, and refresh release collateral.
- v1.2.0t (REF 1.2.0t-A01): tighten target library overlay gating with manifest axis checks, block JWST CALINTS cubes, surface clearer disabled-button guidance, and extend regression coverage.
- v1.2.0v: Retire the example browser and streamline the Examples sidebar around quick-add shortcuts.
- v1.2.0x: Finalize overlay ingestion on the main thread to avoid ScriptRunContext warnings.
- v1.2.0y: Canonicalise FITS wavelength unit aliases before validation and extend byte-string regression coverage.
- v1.2.0z: Remove FITS time-series epoch offsets from overlay payloads and surface reference epochs in the UI.
- v1.2.1a: Accept legacy overlay ingest results after reruns and extend async queue regression coverage.
- v1.2.1 (REF 1.2.1-A01): relocate overlay trace helpers onto OverlayTrace, add a direct `_build_overlay_figure` regression, and roll continuity collateral.
- v1.2.1f: Bootstrap package imports for Streamlit file entry points so the UI loads without ModuleNotFound errors during cloud deployments.
- v1.2.1g: Capture a SpecViz adoption blueprint and refresh release metadata for the research handoff.
- v1.2.1h: Review Jdaviz GitHub design docs, audit current Spectra App architecture, and outline alignment tasks for the next phase.
- v1.2.1i: Introduce a registry-driven layout engine so sidebar controls and workspace tabs register like plugins before render.
- v1.2.1j: Clean up merge conflict markers and revert speculative plugin roadmap docs to restore the v1.2.1i application state.
- v1.2.1k: Add JCAMP-DX ingestion so NIST IR uploads convert to nanometres, ignore uncertainty traces, and ship with regression coverage.
