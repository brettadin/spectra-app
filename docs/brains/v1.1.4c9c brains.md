# MAKE NEW BRAINS EACH TIME YOU MAKE A CHANGE. DO NOT OVER WRITE PREVIOUS BRAINS
# v1.1.4c9c Brains â€” EntryFix

## What we learned
- Blank screens usually indicate the wrong entrypoint is called.
- Our prior patches hard-coded or missed actual callable entrypoints in `app_merged`.
- A robust dispatcher should try multiple possible entry functions before giving up.

## Approach now
- `app_patched.py` is a dispatcher, not app logic.
- It imports `app.app_merged`, inspects exports, and calls the first matching candidate (`render`, `main`, `app`, `ui`, `entry`).
- If no match, it runs the module as `__main__`.

## Rules going forward
1. Do not strip UI elements when patching core dispatch.
2. Always preserve backups of `app_patched.py`.
3. Maintain log output in `logs/ui_debug.log` for every import and entry attempt.
4. Never assume one fixed entrypoint name; apps drift, dispatcher must adapt.
