# MAKE NEW BRAINS EACH TIME YOU MAKE A CHANGE. DO NOT OVER WRITE PREVIOUS BRAINS
# Brains â€” v1.1.4c9 (SmartEntry)

## Problem
Upstream guard stopped executing UI at import time. Streamlit imported `app.app_merged`, found no callable entry (`main`/`render`), and rendered nothing.

## Decision
Ship **SmartEntry** in `app/app_patched.py` that:
- Prefers callables (env `SPECTRA_APP_ENTRY` or `render/main/ui/entry/app/run`).
- Otherwise executes the module as `__main__` via `runpy.run_module`.
- Logs to `logs/ui_debug.log`.

## Usage
1. `RUN_CMDS\Apply-v1.1.4c9-SmartEntry.ps1`
2. `RUN_CMDS\Start-Spectra-Patched.ps1`

## Notes
Non-invasive: leaves `app_merged.py` untouched.
