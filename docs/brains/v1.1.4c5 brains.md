# \# MAKE NEW BRAINS EACH TIME YOU MAKE A CHANGE. DO NOT OVER WRITE PREVIOUS BRAINS

# Brains â€” v1.1.4c5 StrongGuard

Blank screen with no logs means failure before our prior handlers ran or a SystemExit was thrown.
This guard:

* Writes a boot marker.
* Catches BaseException around both import and main dispatch.
* Hooks sys.exit and sys.excepthook to force logs.

We can now prove where the failure happens and fix the root cause with a tiny code patch.
