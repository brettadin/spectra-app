# Brains â€” v1.1.4c4 Entry Repair
We replaced the entry module with a minimal, clean loader that:
- reloads `app.app_merged` each run,
- writes any import traceback to `logs/ui_debug.log`,
- shows the traceback in-app via `st.error` + expander,
- then re-raises to keep Streamlit state sane.

This prevents silent blanks and captures early import failures that occur before the in-UI debug wrapper can run.
