Some versions of our UI module only render when executed as the *main* Streamlit script
(e.g., code under `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`). Importing the module doesn't
trigger that path. Running with `runpy.run_module(..., run_name="__main__")` preserves
Streamlit semantics while keeping our logging and error surfacing intact.
