Generated: 2025-09-19T21:02:14Z

## State of Repo
- Repo is runnable and version-stamped in UI/exports.
- Patch discipline locked: root + longform notes.
- AI handoff prompt updated with roadmap.
- Runners verified and cleaned.

## What I did
- Normalized all docs to UTF-8 to avoid garbled characters in PowerShell.
- Clarified patch discipline in logs and docs.
- Expanded AI handoff with UTF-8 + provenance enforcement notes.
- Updated Verify-Project.ps1 for UTF-8 safety.

## Lessons (do/don't)
- **Do** always update version.json + patch notes.  
- **Do** write candid brains notes.  
- **Do** regenerate CHECKSUMS.txt.  
- **Don’t** overwrite repo wholesale.  
- **Don’t** let legends or provenance go missing.
