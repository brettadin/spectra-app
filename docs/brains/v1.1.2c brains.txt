Spectra App — v1.1.2c brains.txt

## What I did
- Finalized pre-handoff: enforced dual-location patch notes, validated runners, ensured version appears in UI and export manifests, added this brains file and updated AI handoff.

## How I did it
- Minimal, targeted patch files to avoid repo churn. Used append files for root logs, longform notes in docs/patches.
- Kept commands deterministic via RUN_CMDS scripts; added Verify-Project checks for brains + ai_handoff folders.

## What worked
- version.json + UI badge + export watermark removed ambiguity in screenshots and test artifacts.
- Dual-location patch notes keep both humans and AIs happy: quick history + detailed narrative.
- Runners made launches consistent across sessions and machines.

## What didn’t work (watch for this)
- If PATCHLOG.txt at root is missing, CI and new devs get confused. Always append the short entry.
- People forget to regenerate CHECKSUMS.txt. Wire it into your release step if possible.

## Lessons for next AI
- Treat provenance as a first-class citizen. No dataset without provenance.json; log conversions and transformations.
- Enforce dedupe on uploads; checksum everything.
- Keep legends clean. An empty legend label means something else is broken upstream.
- Collect acceptance criteria artifacts (PNG/CSV/manifest) for every feature you touch.
