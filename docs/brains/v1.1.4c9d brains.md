# MAKE NEW BRAINS EACH TIME YOU MAKE A CHANGE. DO NOT OVER WRITE PREVIOUS BRAINS
# v1.1.4c9d â€” Brains
Principle: the app must export a stable UI entrypoint.

Playbook:
- Keep full UI in `app/ui/main.py` (import-time render acceptable).
- Provide `app/ui/entry.py::render()` so loaders have a defined callable.
- Also export `render()` from `app/app_merged.py` that simply delegates.
- Always log patch actions and keep backups.

This prevents the "blank screen" class of failures where the loader falls back to running the module with no visible UI.
