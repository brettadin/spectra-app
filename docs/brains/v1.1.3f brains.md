# Spectra App â€” Brains Log (v1.1.3f)
_Last updated: 2025-09-19T23:07:13.820254Z_

## Purpose of the Brains File
The **Brains file** is the growing database of observations, mistakes, and fixes made during Spectra App development.  
It acts as memory across patches so no lessons are lost. Every time we patch, this file must be updated and shipped inside the `docs/` folder.

The Brains file is as important as the code itself. Without it, we risk repeating the same mistakes.

---

## Rules for the Brains File
1. **Always versioned**: Each patch must include a Brains file named `Brains_v<version>.md`.  
   Example: `Brains_v1.1.3f.md`.

2. **Always shipped**: It must live in the `docs/` folder of the repo and travel in every patch zip.

3. **Always updated**: After testing or patching, append new lessons, issues, or fixes. Never discard older logs.

4. **Readable**: Written in Markdown for easy viewing and diffing. No binary, no zip unless bundling extras is unavoidable.

5. **Single source of truth**: If there is ever a mismatch between memories and Brains file, the Brains file in `docs/` wins.

## How to Use the Brains File
- **Developers**: Read the Brains file before starting work on a new patch to avoid repeating mistakes.  
- **Maintainers**: Update the Brains file when making changes. Treat it as documentation of *how* and *why* things were done.  
- **Future AI**: Refer to the Brains file first for context, continuity, and knowledge transfer.

---

## What to Record
- **Working features** (to preserve them).  
- **Broken behaviors** (to avoid regression).  
- **Mistakes made** and how they were corrected.  
- **UX observations** (pain points, confusing flows).  
- **Export & provenance expectations**.  
- **Next steps** or unresolved issues.

Always write in plain language so future maintainers (human or AI) can follow.

---

## Accessing the Brains File
- Location: `C:\Code\spectra-app\docs\brains\Brains_v<version>.md`  
- Accessible in every shipped patch zip under `Code\spectra-app\docs\brains\`  
- Stored alongside `PATCH_NOTES_v<version>.md` and `ui_contract.json`

---

## Recording Workflow
1. Run tests (overlay, differential, unit toggles, ingest, duplicate guard).  
2. Note what worked, what broke, and any weird UX.  
3. Append these notes into the Brains file under the current version.  
4. Save and commit alongside patch notes.  
5. Ship it in the next zip.

---

## Summary
The Brains file is the **institutional memory** of the Spectra App project.  
It ensures continuity across versions, prevents repeat mistakes, and provides guidance for both human developers and AI maintainers.

Future patches must always update this file. If the Brains are missing, continuity is broken.
