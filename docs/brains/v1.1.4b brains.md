# Brains — v1.1.4b: Entry Realignment and UI Restore

**Intent:** Keep the UI contract intact while avoiding refactors during recovery.

**Action:** Point `app/app_patched.py` at `app.app_merged` (the feature‑complete UI) and wrap with a safe reloader so any exceptions render on‑screen.

**Why:** The thin `app.ui.main` in v1.1.4x lacked critical controls after a nested zip overwrite. The merged module already implements:
- Sidebar: Examples, Display mode, Display units, Duplicate scope, Export
- Tabs: Overlay, Differential, Docs
- Provenance/session logs and duplicate ledger
- Example ingest with CSVs

**Repro/verify:** See patch notes v1.1.4b.

**Next:** Once stable, we can gradually port sections back into `app.ui.main` behind parity checks, then flip entry to `app.ui.main` again.
