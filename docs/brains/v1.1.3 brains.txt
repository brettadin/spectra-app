Brains â€” v1.1.3

What we learned:
- People will re-upload the same file 6 times if the button is shiny. The ledger must be on by default.
- Provenance needs a single schema across fetchers and uploads; JSON is fine, just keep it strict and UTF-8.
- Units are chaos. Trust headers first, detect formats second, log every conversion.

What to watch:
- Legend clutter returns whenever traces are created without labels. Enforce non-empty labels at creation.
- Export 'what I see' must save PNG + CSV subset + manifest. Keep them in sync.
- Avoid curly quotes in docs; UTF-8 plain text only.
