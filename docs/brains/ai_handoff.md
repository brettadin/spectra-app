# üîë BRAINS FIRST ‚Äî DO NOT SKIP

All contributors must consult the Brains before making changes.  
- The canonical knowledge base is in `docs/brains/brains_<version>.md` (use the latest version).  
- Every change/learning must be recorded there with a new **REF code**:
  - Format: `<PATCH>-<PART><SEQ>` (e.g., 1.1.5b-A01).  
  - Each REF entry includes: What, Why, Where, How, Verification, Provenance.  
- REF codes must be:
  - Cross-referenced in `PATCHLOG.txt`  
  - Included in commit messages and PR descriptions  
  - Linked in the AI handoff prompts for continuity  

**Contract checkpoints (must remain true every patch):**  
- Unit toggles are idempotent (always from canonical baseline).  
- FŒΩ/FŒª are never mixed on the same axis; axes are labeled with units.  
- Legends have no empties or duplicates; metadata is always shown.  
- Exports include PNG + CSV + manifest with provenance.  
- Duplicate guard and provenance logs are intact.  

‚û°Ô∏è **If you are coding, updating, or patching:**  
1. Read the latest Brains doc in full.  
2. Add your new learnings to Brains with a REF code.  
3. Cite the REF in `PATCHLOG.txt`, commit messages, and future handoffs.  
4. Prepare necessary AI handoff notes for the next iteration.

This bridge document ties the brains log to the operative AI handoff prompt.
It is part of the mandated continuity template: Brains ‚Üí AI Handoff ‚Üí Patch Notes.

## Source of Truth
- Current prompt: `docs/ai_handoff/AI_HANDOFF_PROMPT_v1.1.4.md`
- Next revision must update both this bridge and `docs/brains/brains_INDEX.md`.
- Keep handoff prompts UTF-8, versioned, and cross-linked from the paired brains + patch notes.

## Expectations for v1.1.5c
- Reflect the Streamlit width migration so future edits continue using the `width` parameter instead of `use_container_width`.
- Reference `docs/brains/brains_v1.1.5c.md`, `docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.1.5c.txt`, and the Atlas index.
- Capture guidance about similarity label aliasing and the wavelength-metadata fallback alongside the existing ingestion rules.

## Checklist Before Shipping Changes
1. Read the latest brains entry and confirm the scope still matches.
2. Verify `docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.1.5c.txt` lists the same continuity obligations.

## Expectations for v1.1.5b
- Extend the live handoff prompt with guidance about SI-normalised ingestion, provenance logging, and the in-app Atlas docs.
- Ensure the prompt references `docs/brains/brains_v1.1.5b.md`, `docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.1.5b.txt`, and the Atlas index.
- Preserve instructions about provider cache directories and verification scripts.
=======
## Expectations for v1.1.5a+
- Do **not** regenerate the entire prompt‚Äîextend it incrementally.
- Include guidance about the new continuity manifest field and provider cache directories.
- Ensure every future prompt references `docs/brains/brains_v1.1.5a.md` until superseded.
