# Telescopes Overview



You just asked me to unpack \*every\* telescope humans have ever built to spy on stars, planets, and moons. That’s like asking for a list of every ant in the Amazon rainforest, but fine—I’ll do it because I’m apparently your cosmic librarian now. Here’s the landscape, split into \*\*space-based\*\* and \*\*ground-based\*\* observatories. I’ll keep it broad but thorough, so you see the zoo of glass and metal we’ve flung around the universe.

\## Space-Based Observatories



These sit above our messy atmosphere so they don’t have to squint through clouds, water vapor, and light pollution.  



\- \*\*Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\*\* – Visible and near-UV/IR imaging, spectroscopy. The diva of astronomy since 1990.  

\- \*\*James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)\*\* – Infrared powerhouse, deployed 2021. Great for exoplanets, dusty galaxies, and making Hubble look like a flip phone.  

\- \*\*Chandra X-ray Observatory\*\* – Since 1999, studies high-energy sources like black holes and supernova remnants.  

\- \*\*XMM-Newton\*\* – ESA’s X-ray telescope, complementary to Chandra.  

\- \*\*Spitzer Space Telescope\*\* – Retired in 2020, did groundbreaking infrared astronomy.  

\- \*\*Kepler/K2\*\* – Exoplanet hunters via transit photometry. Legacy: thousands of confirmed planets.  

\- \*\*TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite)\*\* – All-sky exoplanet transit mission, successor to Kepler.  

\- \*\*Gaia\*\* – Star-mapper par excellence. Produces the definitive 3D atlas of the Milky Way.  

\- \*\*WISE/NEOWISE\*\* – Infrared survey, re-purposed to track asteroids.  

\- \*\*Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\*\* – Gamma rays, blazars, pulsars, high-energy fireworks.  

\- \*\*Planck\*\* – Measured the cosmic microwave background with absurd precision.  

\- \*\*SOHO\*\* – Sun-watcher since 1995, monitors solar atmosphere and helioseismology.  

\- \*\*Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)\*\* – Constant high-res monitoring of the Sun.  

\- \*\*CHEOPS\*\* – ESA’s characterizer of known exoplanets.  

\- \*\*Euclid\*\* (launched 2023) – Dark matter/dark energy mapper.  

\- \*\*Roman Space Telescope\*\* (planned) – Wide-field infrared surveyor.  



…and dozens of more specialized missions (NuSTAR, Swift, IXPE, Astrosat, Hitomi/Resolve, etc.) for X-ray, gamma, or solar-specific work.

\## Ground-Based Behemoths



Earth is still cheap real estate, so the biggest mirrors live here, albeit cursed by atmosphere and weather. Adaptive optics and interferometry save the day.  



\- \*\*Keck Observatory (Hawaii)\*\* – Twin 10-meter mirrors, kings of optical/IR astronomy.  

\- \*\*Very Large Telescope (VLT, Chile)\*\* – Four 8.2-m telescopes + interferometer mode. Flagship of ESO.  

\- \*\*Extremely Large Telescope (ELT, building in Chile)\*\* – A 39-m monster in progress.  

\- \*\*Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT, “eventually, maybe”)\*\* – Stalled by protests and politics.  

\- \*\*Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT, building in Chile)\*\* – Seven 8.4-m mirrors acting as one.  

\- \*\*Subaru Telescope (Hawaii)\*\* – 8.2-m Japanese optical/IR telescope.  

\- \*\*Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC, Canary Islands)\*\* – 10.4-m segmented mirror.  

\- \*\*Very Large Array (VLA, New Mexico)\*\* – Iconic Y-shaped radio array.  

\- \*\*ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, Chile)\*\* – 66 antennas, stunning resolution in mm/sub-mm.  

\- \*\*FAST (China)\*\* – World’s largest filled-aperture radio dish (500 m).  

\- \*\*Arecibo\*\* – Collapsed in 2020, RIP. The original planetary radar giant.  

\- \*\*LOFAR (Europe)\*\* – Low-frequency radio interferometer.  

\- \*\*SKA (Square Kilometer Array, building in Australia/South Africa)\*\* – Next-gen mega-radio telescope.

\## Planetary and Solar-System Observers



Not everything stares into deep space; some missions obsess over our neighborhood.  



\- \*\*Juno (at Jupiter)\*\* – Magnetosphere, atmosphere, aurorae.  

\- \*\*Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)\*\* – HiRISE camera spying on Mars rovers.  

\- \*\*Cassini (at Saturn, RIP 2017)\*\* – Legendary planetary system observer.  

\- \*\*Voyager 1/2\*\* – Technically still observing plasma waves and fields at interstellar distances.  

\- \*\*New Horizons\*\* – Pluto and beyond, Kuiper Belt explorer.  

\- \*\*Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)\*\* – High-res imaging of the Moon.  

\- \*\*BepiColombo\*\* (en route) – Mercury mission.

\## Amateur and Survey Workhorses



Don’t discount the smaller fry. They find stuff first.  



\- \*\*Pan-STARRS (Hawaii)\*\* – Wide-field survey, asteroid detection, transients.  

\- \*\*Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF, Palomar)\*\* – Fast time-domain astronomy.  

\- \*\*LSST/Vera Rubin Observatory (Chile, coming online)\*\* – Gigantic time-domain survey.  

\- \*\*AAVSO networks\*\* – Amateur astronomers with spectroscopy rigs feeding professional data.

In short: if it shines, screams in X-rays, or sneezes in infrared, someone has built a telescope to stalk it. Inside the solar system, we spy with orbiters and probes; outside, we rely on ground monsters and space telescopes tuned to every wavelength from radio to gamma. Humanity is basically a peeping tom of the cosmos.
