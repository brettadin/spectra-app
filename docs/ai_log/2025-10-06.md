## Tasking — v1.2.0j
- Relocate the similarity analysis panel into the Differential workspace so it only appears when comparison inputs exist.
- Ensure the Overlay tab still surfaces metadata and line tables after the move.
- Refresh UI contract, brains, patch notes, and regression coverage per the v1.2 continuity rules.

## Actions & Decisions
- Reviewed the v1.2+ handoff protocol to confirm continuity requirements before editing UI layout docs and tests. 【F:docs/ai_handoff/Spectra App v1.2+ – Handoff Protocol & Task Blueprint.txt†L1-L35】
- Moved similarity vector preparation and rendering from `_render_overlay_tab` to `_render_differential_tab`, gating the panel on two or more spectral overlays and reusing the active viewport. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L2215-L2271】【F:app/ui/main.py†L2474-L2528】
- Extended the differential AppTest to assert the relocated "Similarity analysis" heading, and added an overlay AppTest to ensure metadata and line tables still render. 【F:tests/ui/test_differential_form.py†L1-L86】【F:tests/ui/test_metadata_summary.py†L1-L156】
- Updated the UI contract, brains index, patch notes (md/txt), patch log, version metadata, and new brains entry to document the change. 【F:docs/ui_contract.json†L1-L29】【F:docs/brains/brains_INDEX.md†L1-L48】【F:docs/patch_notes/v1.2.0j.md†L1-L24】【F:docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.2.0j.txt†L1-L3】【F:PATCHLOG.txt†L1-L26】【F:app/version.json†L1-L5】【F:docs/brains/brains_v1.2.0j.md†L1-L19】

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_differential_form.py`
- `pytest tests/ui/test_metadata_summary.py`

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Add inline guidance in the Differential workspace describing how similarity metrics complement differential curves.
- Restore the docs search index service noted in earlier continuity logs.

## Docs Consulted
- Spectra App v1.2+ – Handoff Protocol & Task Blueprint. 【F:docs/ai_handoff/Spectra App v1.2+ – Handoff Protocol & Task Blueprint.txt†L1-L35】

## Tasking — v1.2.1o
- Restore local overlay uploads by importing the checksum helper dependency that was missed during recent refactors.

## Actions & Decisions
- Added the missing `hashlib` import in the Streamlit UI module so uploaded file payloads can compute SHA-256 checksums without triggering a `NameError`. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L1-L80】
- Bumped version metadata and published new patch notes to record the hotfix for release consumers. 【F:app/version.json†L1-L5】【F:docs/patch_notes/v1.2.1o.md†L1-L8】
- Logged the fix in the brains ledger to document the ingestion dependency context for future refactors. 【F:docs/atlas/brains.md†L1-L6】

## Verification
- Not run (import-only hotfix; Streamlit runtime pending manual confirmation).

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Add automated coverage for local upload checksum calculation to prevent missing dependency regressions.

## Docs Consulted
- None (code inspection only).
