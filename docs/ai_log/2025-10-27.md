## Tasking — Restore clean v1.2.1 baseline
- Remove merge conflict artifacts introduced during an aborted plugin refactor and realign release collateral.

## Actions & Decisions
- Cleared conflict markers and redundant imports from the Streamlit UI entrypoint so the module compiles again. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L1-L120】
- Reverted release metadata and brains documentation to reflect the delivered v1.2.1i feature set, dropping speculative plugin notes. 【F:app/version.json†L1-L5】【F:docs/atlas/brains.md†L1-L120】
- Added v1.2.1j patch notes and patch log entries documenting the cleanup for release tracking. 【F:docs/patch_notes/v1.2.1j.md†L1-L12】【F:PATCHLOG.txt†L33-L36】

## Verification
- `python -m compileall app/ui/main.py`

## Docs Consulted
- None (code inspection only).

## Tasking — Guard against merge regressions
- Add regression coverage to prevent Git conflict markers from re-entering the Streamlit UI entrypoint.

## Actions & Decisions
- Created a pytest that scans `app/ui/main.py` for Git conflict sentinels so future merges fail fast when artifacts sneak in. 【F:tests/test_no_merge_conflicts.py†L1-L15】
- Synced version metadata, patch notes, and the patch log to record the safeguard for release automation. 【F:app/version.json†L1-L5】【F:docs/patch_notes/v1.2.1k.md†L1-L9】【F:PATCHLOG.txt†L31-L36】

## Verification
- `pytest tests/test_no_merge_conflicts.py`

## Docs Consulted
- None (code inspection only).
