## Status bar axis title import guard
- Summary: Re-linked the controller axis title helper into the Streamlit UI after the service refactor so the workspace status bar stops throwing a NameError during render.
- References: None (local reasoning only).
- Files: `app/ui/main.py`, `app/version.json`, `docs/patch_notes/v1.2.1n.md`, `docs/atlas/brains.md`.
- Verification: `python -m compileall app/ui/main.py`.
