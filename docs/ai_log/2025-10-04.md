## Tasking — v1.2.0h
- Move the example quick-add workflows into the sidebar beneath the display controls.
- Keep the Library tab focused on guidance while preserving targets and uploads tooling.
- Update regression coverage and continuity artefacts (version, brains, patch notes, patch log, UI contract, AI log).

## Actions & Decisions
- Re-read the v1.2+ handoff blueprint to confirm the sidebar and continuity requirements before touching the UI. 【F:docs/ai_handoff/Spectra App v1.2+ – Handoff Protocol & Task Blueprint.txt†L1-L35】
- Refactored `_render_examples_group` with compact expanders and sidebar-friendly widgets, then invoked it from `_render_settings_group` immediately after the display controls so quick-add tools live with other session settings. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L811-L902】【F:app/ui/main.py†L1097-L1118】
- Replaced the Library tab's embedded examples panel with an informational callout that points users to the sidebar controls, avoiding duplicate widgets. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L2534-L2557】
- Added Streamlit AppTest coverage that validates the sidebar forms and the updated Library copy, and refreshed the UI contract to enumerate the new "Examples library" section. 【F:tests/ui/test_sidebar_examples.py†L1-L52】【F:docs/ui_contract.json†L1-L37】
- Bumped the app version and regenerated continuity artefacts (patch notes, plaintext summary, brains entry, brains index, patch log) to record the relocation. 【F:app/version.json†L1-L4】【F:docs/patch_notes/v1.2.0h.md†L1-L22】【F:docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.2.0h.txt†L1-L3】【F:docs/brains/brains_v1.2.0h.md†L1-L21】【F:docs/brains/brains_INDEX.md†L1-L40】【F:PATCHLOG.txt†L18-L19】

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_sidebar_examples.py tests/ui/test_sidebar_line_catalog.py` 【1c12f7†L1-L4】

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Explore a sidebar compact mode once we revisit the SIMBAD resolver backlog so multiple expanders can co-exist without excessive scrolling.
- Restore the FAISS-backed docs index service to satisfy the standing RAG requirement called out in prior logs.
