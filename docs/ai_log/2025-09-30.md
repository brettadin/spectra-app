## Tasking
- Address crash in FITS table ingestion when provenance attempted to reference an undefined non-positive row counter.
- Recreate missing runtime inventory documentation and roll continuity artifacts for the v1.2.0 handoff.

## Actions & Decisions
- Verified environment package versions via `importlib.metadata` because `docs/runtime.json` was absent; recorded the snapshot (REF 1.2.0-C01).
- Inspected `_extract_table_data` in `app/server/ingest_fits.py` and refactored the non-positive filtering logic to define a consolidated `dropped_nonpositive_rows` counter, eliminating the undefined variable reference (REF 1.2.0-A01).
- Added regression coverage in `tests/server/test_ingest_fits.py` to ingest a wavenumber column containing zero/negative values and assert the provenance fields.
- Attempted to query `tools/search_server.py` per protocol, but the script is missing in this repository snapshot; noted for future restoration.
- Updated `app/version.json`, patch notes, brains, AI handoff prompt, and patch log to introduce v1.2.0 continuity entries.

## Outstanding Follow-ups
- Rebuild the documentation mirror tooling referenced in historical instructions so `docs/sources.yaml` and related indices can be regenerated once restored.
- Execute `Verify-Project.ps1` in a Windows environment and confirm ingestion roadmap tasks (SIMBAD resolver, archive consolidation, provenance enrichment) progress in subsequent patches.
