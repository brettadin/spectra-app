**Purpose:** Render project docs browser.

## Required behavior
- Never clear the whole page; render within a container.
- If file read fails, render `st.error` with the path and exception, and log to `ui_debug.log`.

## Known issues
- Handler switched the route and returned early after an exception, leaving no frame.
- Fix by ensuring the main `render()` always paints a skeleton before dispatching to panels.
