# Spectroscopy Math Part 1





\# Spectroscopy Math Pack (Part 1 of 2)



This file covers the mathematical foundations of spectroscopy: absorption, emission, blackbody radiation, Doppler shifts, line broadening, and radiative transfer.

\## 1. Beer–Lambert Law (Absorption)

I(λ) = I₀(λ) \* exp\[-α(λ) \* l]



\- I₀: incident intensity

\- I: transmitted intensity

\- α: absorption coefficient

\- l: path length



Alternative form with concentration:

A = log₁₀(I₀/I) = ε(λ) \* c \* l



---



\## 2. Planck’s Law (Blackbody Radiation)



Wavelength form:

B\_λ(λ, T) = (2hc² / λ⁵) \* \[1 / (exp(hc / (λ k\_B T)) - 1)]



Frequency form:

B\_ν(ν, T) = (2hν³ / c²) \* \[1 / (exp(hν / (k\_B T)) - 1)]



From this come:

\- Wien’s Law: λ\_max \* T = b

\- Stefan–Boltzmann Law: j\* = σT⁴



---



\## 3. Doppler Shift (Motion)



Δλ / λ₀ = v / c



For relativistic speeds:

λ / λ₀ = sqrt\[(1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c)]

\## 4. Energy Levels → Spectral Lines



Hydrogen-like atoms (Bohr model):

E\_n = -13.6 eV / n²



Transition:

ΔE = E\_{n2} - E\_{n1} = hν = hc/λ



---



\## 5. Line Broadening



\- Natural broadening (uncertainty principle):

ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2



\- Doppler (thermal motion):

Δλ\_D = λ₀ sqrt\[2k\_B T / (mc²)]



\- Pressure broadening: ∝ density



Overall profile: Voigt function (Lorentzian \* Gaussian).



---



\## 6. Radiative Transfer Equation



dI\_ν/ds = -κ\_ν I\_ν + j\_ν



\- I\_ν: intensity at frequency ν

\- κ\_ν: absorption coefficient

\- j\_ν: emission coefficient



Defines the \*\*source function\*\*:

S\_ν = j\_ν / κ\_ν



---



\## 7. Polarization (Stokes Parameters)



I: total intensity

Q, U: linear polarization

V: circular polarization



Used in Zeeman splitting and magnetism studies.



---



\## 8. Units \& Conversions



λ (nm, Å, µm), ν (Hz), ν̃ (cm⁻¹)



ν̃ = 1/λ,   ν = c/λ
