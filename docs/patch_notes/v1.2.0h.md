# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0h

## Summary
- Move the curated example quick-add controls into the sidebar session stack and streamline the Library tab copy.
- Expand UI regression coverage for the relocated examples panel and document the new sidebar contract.

## Details
1. **Sidebar refresh**
   - Render the examples quick-add button, favourites, and recents within the sidebar beneath the display controls, with compact expanders for optional lists.
   - Replace the Library tab's embedded examples panel with guidance that points users to the sidebar controls.
2. **Contract and coverage**
   - Update the UI contract to enumerate the "Examples library" sidebar section.
   - Add Streamlit AppTest coverage to ensure the sidebar exposes the quick-add forms and that the Library tab copy references the sidebar move.
3. **Continuity**
   - Bump the app version and refresh continuity artefacts (brains, patch notes, UI contract, patch log, AI log) for v1.2.0h.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_sidebar_examples.py`
- `pytest tests/ui/test_sidebar_line_catalog.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0h with updates to the brains index/log, UI contract, AI log, and plaintext patch notes.
