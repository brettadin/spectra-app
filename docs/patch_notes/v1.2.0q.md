# Patch Notes — v1.2.0q

## Summary
- Move overlay ingestion to a session-scoped background worker with sidebar progress tracking.

## Details
1. **Threaded ingest queue runtime**
   - Added a session-managed `ThreadPoolExecutor`, per-job state tracking, and progress callbacks so overlay downloads run asynchronously without blocking rerenders. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L526-L792】
2. **Sidebar progress and completion messaging**
   - Surfaced an “Overlay downloads” panel that lists queued, running, and completed items with live status captions and success/error callouts tied to the new runtime snapshot. 【F:app/ui/main.py†L795-L839】【F:app/ui/main.py†L3426-L3451】
3. **Regression coverage for long downloads**
   - Exercised a simulated slow network fetch to confirm queued overlays stay interactive across reruns and finish with completion banners once released. 【F:tests/ui/test_overlay_ingest_queue_async.py†L12-L112】

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_overlay_ingest_queue_async.py::test_ingest_queue_remains_interactive_during_long_download`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0q with brains and AI log updates recorded.
