Summary:
- Initialize folder hierarchy, run scripts, docs seed, examples, and UI skeleton.
- Enforce provenance-first architecture, unit rigor, overlay toggles, and differential workspace stubs.

Known issues:
- Archive fetchers are stubbed.
- Differential math is placeholder.
- Export manifest currently includes basic structure only.

Next:
- Implement MAST/ESO/SDSS fetch with provenance.json per dataset.
- Wire unit resolver and duplicate-upload guard (checksum index).
- Finish differential alignment, resampling, and logging.
