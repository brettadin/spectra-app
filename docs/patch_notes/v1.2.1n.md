# Spectra App v1.2.1n — 2025-10-27

## Summary
- Add a NIST Quantitative IR fetcher that parses the catalog, resolves 0.125 cm⁻¹ JCAMP spectra, and normalises metadata and provenance for overlays.
- Surface a preset molecule selector in the line catalog panel with availability hints and cached catalog lookups.
- Document the workflow in the quick start guide and back the catalog parsing utilities with unit tests.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/server/test_nist_quant_ir.py -q`
