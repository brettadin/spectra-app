# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0e

## Summary
- Drive the app header caption from the active patch metadata so release info stays aligned even when `version.json` lags.
- Add regression coverage to ensure the header continues to prioritize the patch version string.

## Details
1. **Header caption**
   - Introduced `_render_app_header` to centralize the Spectra App title and caption logic.
   - The caption now prefers the resolved `patch_version` and formatted timestamp, matching the Docs tab banner and patch log.
2. **UI coverage**
   - Extended `tests/ui/test_docs_tab.py` with `test_header_prefers_patch_version` to assert the header caption uses the patch metadata and includes the formatted timestamp.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_docs_tab.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0e with updated patch log, brains index/log, AI handoff brief, plaintext patch note, and AI activity log entry.
