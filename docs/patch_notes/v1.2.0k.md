# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0k

## Summary
- Redesign the target catalog panel with search filters, manifest highlights, and grouped overlay actions so selections read top-to-bottom.
- Extend UI regression coverage to lock the new layout and verify manifest summaries stay visible.

## Details
1. **Catalog discovery refresh**
   - Move the target picker above the catalog table and add a search box plus curated/planet filters to narrow large lists quickly.
   - Render the filtered catalog table after the manifest summary so readers confirm context without losing the selection.
2. **Manifest visibility**
   - Surface canonical name, autop summary, curated counts, and archive flags via metrics and captions pulled directly from the manifest.
   - Show coordinates alongside archive availability, preserving the truncated-observation notice when MAST returns partial results.
3. **Product organization**
   - Group curated spectra by collection label with an optional filter so overlay buttons align with the manifest metadata.
   - Keep overlay eligibility messaging intact while limiting the rendered list to 200 entries per Streamlit rerun.
4. **Regression coverage**
   - Add an AppTest that asserts the presence of search/filters, manifest metrics, and the new collection filter in the panel.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_targets_panel_layout.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0k with refreshed patch notes, plaintext summary, patch log entry, brains log/index, AI handoff prompt, and AI activity log updates.
