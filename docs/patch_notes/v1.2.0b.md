# Patch Notes — v1.2.0b

## Summary
- Add first-class support for FITS time-series tables (TIME columns with BJD/MJD/seconds units) and surface them as `axis_kind="time"` payloads instead of failing wavelength validation.
- Update overlay plotting and metadata rendering so time axes display their native units, ranges, and provenance alongside flux.
- Expand regression coverage for light-curve ingestion and metadata summaries to guard the new pathway.

## Details
1. **FITS ingestion**
   - `_extract_table_data` recognises time-labelled columns and unit tokens (`BJD`, `MJD`, seconds, minutes, hours, days) before running spectral-only validation.
   - `_ingest_table_hdu` bubbles time-axis information through provenance (`time_converted_to`, `time_original_unit`) and exposes a dedicated `time` payload for downstream consumers.
2. **UI updates**
   - Overlay traces carry an `axis_kind` flag; the plotter now renders time axes with `Time (...)` labels and preserves canonical values for differential math.
   - Metadata summary tables replace the fixed “Range (nm)” column with a unified “Axis range” that reports either nm or the provided time unit.
3. **Regression tests**
   - Added `test_parse_fits_accepts_time_series_units` to confirm ingestion, provenance, and metadata for BJD light curves.
   - Extended UI metadata tests with a time-series scenario to confirm the new axis labelling.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/server/test_ingest_fits.py::test_parse_fits_accepts_time_series_units`
- `pytest tests/ui/test_metadata_summary.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0b with updated brains (`docs/brains/brains_v1.2.0b.md`), AI handoff (`docs/ai_handoff/AI_HANDOFF_PROMPT_v1.2.0b.md`), patch notes (this file & `docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.2.0b.txt`), patch log, and AI log (`docs/ai_log/2025-09-30.md`).
