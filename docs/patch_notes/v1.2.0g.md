# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0g

## Summary
- Relocate the NIST line catalog tools from the Library tab into the sidebar session controls and validate the new placement.
- Refresh continuity collateral to record the sidebar update and new regression coverage.

## Details
1. **Sidebar integration**
   - Move the NIST form into the sidebar settings container so line catalog fetches live alongside network and display toggles.
   - Remove the redundant Library tab container and update the tab copy now that line catalogs live in the controls panel.
2. **Regression coverage**
   - Add Streamlit AppTest coverage to ensure the sidebar renders the NIST form when online and surfaces the offline notice when archive fetchers are disabled.
3. **Continuity**
   - Bump the app version, extend the UI contract artefact with the sidebar section, and refresh brains, patch logs, and AI activity notes per the v1.2 blueprint.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_sidebar_line_catalog.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0g with updates to the brains index/log, UI contract, AI log, and plaintext patch notes.
