# v1.2.1aa — 2025-10-28

- stop attaching synthetic cm⁻¹ arrays to Quant IR payloads so overlays only include the raw samples returned by NIST
- keep wavelength metadata/preferences aligned with the reported unit instead of forcing a cm⁻¹ default
- document the release metadata bump covering the raw-unit preservation fix
