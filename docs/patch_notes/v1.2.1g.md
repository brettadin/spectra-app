## Summary
- Compiled a SpecViz adaptation blueprint covering Jdaviz capabilities, Spectra App gaps, and a phased roadmap for adoption. 【F:docs/research/specviz_adaptation.md†L3-L133】
- Recorded the research outcome in the brains log and refreshed release metadata to keep continuity collateral aligned. 【F:docs/atlas/brains.md†L205-L210】【F:app/version.json†L1-L5】【F:PATCHLOG.txt†L37-L38】

## Details
