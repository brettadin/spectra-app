# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0l

## Summary
- Separate overlay viewport state by axis kind so time-series traces no longer clamp spectral plots and mixed overlays surface a dedicated warning.

## Details
1. **Viewport segregation**
   - Maintain per-axis viewport preferences in session state and reuse them across overlay, differential, and export flows.
   - Exclude time-series overlays when computing spectral auto ranges and pass axis-specific windows into render/export helpers.
2. **Mixed axis UX**
   - Label charts with a "Mixed axes" title and sidebar warning when time and wavelength traces coexist, skipping shared x-axis clamps.
   - Enrich exports with axis kind metadata and preserve time-series points even when the spectral viewport is narrowed.
3. **Regression coverage**
   - Extend auto viewport tests for time-series mixes and add a mixed-axis overlay rendering check alongside existing hover/full-resolution cases.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_auto_viewport.py tests/ui/test_overlay_full_resolution.py tests/ui/test_overlay_hover.py tests/ui/test_overlay_mixed_axes.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0l with refreshed brains log/index, patch notes, AI log entry, and handoff summary.
