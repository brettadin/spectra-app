# PATCH_NOTES_v1.1.4c9d — UIShim
Date (UTC): 2025-09-20T04:06:49Z

## Summary
Restores a deterministic UI entrypoint without modifying your UI logic:
- Adds `app/ui/entry.py` with `render()` that imports `app.ui.main` and calls a suitable function if present.
- Appends a `render()` shim to `app/app_merged.py` that delegates to `app.ui.entry.render()`.

## Why
SmartEntry could not find any callable UI in `app.app_merged` (only `Path`). Your UI lives in `app/ui/main.py` but doesn’t expose a callable. This shim gives the loader something reliable to call.

## Files
- `RUN_CMDS/Apply-v1.1.4c9d-UIShim.ps1` (idempotent installer; backup `app/app_merged.py.bak.v1.1.4c9d`).
- `RUN_CMDS/payload/entry.py` (copied to `app/ui/entry.py` when missing).
- `RUN_CMDS/payload/merged_render_shim.txt` (appended to `app/app_merged.py` when needed).

## Apply
```powershell
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File RUN_CMDS\Apply-v1.1.4c9d-UIShim.ps1
C:\Code\spectra-app\RUN_CMDS\Start-Spectra-Patched.ps1
```

## Rollback
Restore `app/app_merged.py` from `.bak.v1.1.4c9d`. Optionally delete `app/ui/entry.py`.

## Scope
- No removal of features, no change to badge or ingest logic.
- Only provides tiny entry shims so the existing UI renders again.
