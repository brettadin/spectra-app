# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0d

## Summary
- Disable overlay ingestion for MAST products that are not 1-D spectra, SEDs, or time-series and surface a helper note for unsupported entries.
- Add focused regression coverage that proves image-type products are annotated instead of enqueued for overlay.

## Details
1. **Overlay gating**
   - Introduced `_product_overlay_support` in `app/ui/targets.py` so image/cube entries render a disabled button with context while 1-D products continue to enqueue traces.
   - Normalised dataproduct type handling and ensured missing or unknown types are treated as unsupported for overlays.
2. **Regression coverage**
   - Added `tests/ui/test_targets_overlay_support.py` to confirm spectra/time-series remain eligible and image rows present the explanatory annotation.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_targets_overlay_support.py`
