# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0j

## Summary
- Relocate the similarity analysis panel into the Differential workspace so comparison tooling lives together.
- Refresh UI contract guidance and regression coverage to lock the new layout while keeping overlay metadata tables intact.

## Details
1. **Differential workspace alignment**
   - Move similarity vector preparation and the `render_similarity_panel` call from the overlay tab into `_render_differential_tab`.
   - Only surface the panel when at least two non-line spectra are available, reusing viewport defaults for consistent scoring.
2. **Overlay continuity**
   - Leave metadata and line table renderers in place so the overlay tab still reports contextual details without the similarity UI.
   - Add an AppTest that loads both spectrum and line overlays to assert the tables continue rendering.
3. **Regression updates**
   - Extend the differential AppTest to expect the relocated similarity heading.
   - Update the UI contract version and must-have list to reflect the new panel placement.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_differential_form.py`
- `pytest tests/ui/test_metadata_summary.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0j with aligned brains index entry, patch notes, patch log, and AI log updates.
