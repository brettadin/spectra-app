# Spectra App v1.2.1k — JCAMP-DX overlay ingestion

## Summary
- Added a JCAMP-DX parser that normalises XYDATA blocks, converts reported wavelength units to nanometres, skips uncertainty sections, and preserves provenance for cache/downsample workflows. 【F:app/server/ingest_jcamp.py†L1-L386】
- Updated local upload detection to recognise `.jdx` headers/extensions and route payloads through the JCAMP parser while leaving existing ASCII/FITS paths untouched. 【F:app/utils/local_ingest.py†L11-L75】【F:app/utils/local_ingest.py†L305-L404】
- Introduced regression coverage that ingests a multi-section JCAMP sample to confirm spectra render while uncertainty traces stay excluded. 【F:tests/server/test_local_ingest.py†L360-L403】

## Verification
- `pytest tests/server/test_local_ingest.py::test_ingest_local_jcamp_xydata_skips_uncertainty -q` 【9198e9†L1-L2】
