# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0i

## Summary
- Relocate the reference trace selector and clear action into the Differential tab so comparison tools live together.
- Add regression coverage ensuring the new differential controls render alongside the existing form.

## Details
1. **Differential workspace alignment**
   - Render the reference trace selector and clear overlays button directly within the Differential tab header.
   - Keep the selection state in sync with overlay updates so downstream plots and similarity panels continue to respect the chosen reference.
2. **Sidebar simplification**
   - Remove the reference controls from the Examples sidebar group, leaving only example/library tooling in that section.
3. **Coverage and continuity**
   - Extend the differential UI AppTest to assert the presence and behaviour of the relocated reference controls.
   - Bump the app version and refresh brains, patch notes, and AI activity logs for v1.2.0i.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_differential_form.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0i with accompanying brains index/log and AI log updates.
