# v1.2.1z â€” 2025-10-28

- add a secondary y-axis for absorbance overlays so transmittance and absorbance traces retain their native scales without manual conversions
- route absorbance traces to the secondary axis automatically while keeping transmittance and other flux kinds on the primary axis for consistent legends
- update release metadata to announce the dual-axis plotting support
