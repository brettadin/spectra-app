# Patch Notes â€” v1.2.0m

## Summary
- Relocated the overlay clearing control into the Display & viewport sidebar block and surfaced confirmation directly in the overlay workspace.

## Details
1. **Sidebar placement**
   - Render the "Clear overlays" button alongside viewport/display toggles so destructive actions live with overlay management tools.
   - Disable the control when no overlays are loaded and persist the action through the existing `_clear_overlays()` helper.
2. **Workspace feedback**
   - Emit a warning banner within the overlay tab after clearing to confirm the removal in context, even when the overlay list becomes empty.
   - Keep the Differential tab focused on trace selection by removing the destructive control from its reference sidebar.
3. **Regression coverage**
   - Updated the differential form test to ensure the button is absent there and added a sidebar test that asserts the control renders with overlays present.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/ui/test_differential_form.py tests/ui/test_sidebar_display_controls.py`

## Continuity
- Version bumped to v1.2.0m with corresponding brains entry and AI log update.
