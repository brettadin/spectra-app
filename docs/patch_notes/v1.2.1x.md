# v1.2.1x — 2025-10-28

- rebuild the Quant IR manual catalog around the provided NIST WebBook JCAMP spectra so the sidebar presets resolve to the correct references
- derive Beer–Lambert percent transmittance using sample pressure metadata, capture cm⁻¹ axis hints, and extend provenance with pressure-based calibration notes
- refresh the Quant IR UI preset list and regression coverage to reflect the new catalog and axis metadata defaults
