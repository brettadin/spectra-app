# Spectra App Documentation

The Spectra Atlas is the canonical reference for using and extending the application. Access it via the in-app **Docs** tab or directly from the repository:

- [Spectra Atlas â€” Index](atlas/index.md)
- [Brains Log Index](brains/brains_INDEX.md)
- [Patch Notes](PATCH_NOTES/)

Always review the brains log and patch notes alongside the Atlas before shipping changes.
