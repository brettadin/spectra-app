# Bad UI Guide

What not to do and why it hurts science.



UI development is like cooking with too many chefs: everyone’s got opinions, half of them are wrong, and the soup burns while you argue about button shapes. Here’s the messy truth:

\## What I dislike about UI development

\- \*\*Pixel-perfect purists\*\*: people obsessing over a 1px misalignment while ignoring that the whole flow makes no sense.  

\- \*\*Reinvention hell\*\*: every project invents Yet Another Dropdown™ that fails accessibility checks.  

\- \*\*Browser roulette\*\*: Chrome looks fine, Safari says “lol no,” Firefox quietly judges you, and Edge… well, Edge copies Chrome badly.  

\- \*\*The illusion of simplicity\*\*: everyone thinks UI is easy because they’ve “used websites.” That’s like thinking you can do brain surgery because you watched \*House\*.

\## What bad UI design looks like

\- \*\*Overstuffed\*\*: every feature crammed on screen at once, zero hierarchy, looks like a dashboard built by a caffeinated raccoon.  

\- \*\*Invisible affordances\*\*: buttons that don’t look like buttons, links hidden in body text. If you need a treasure map to click something, you failed.  

\- \*\*Inconsistent spacing and alignment\*\*: gives the whole page “I made this in MS Paint” energy.  

\- \*\*Mystery meat navigation\*\*: icons with no labels. Users hover like archaeologists trying to decode your intentions.  

\- \*\*Color chaos\*\*: six shades of blue, none of which mean the same thing.  

\- \*\*Forms from hell\*\*: unlabeled fields, errors that disappear instantly, no “save draft,” validation only after hitting submit.



---



\## What should be avoided

\- \*\*Too many choices\*\*: users freeze up. Give defaults, hide advanced stuff until needed.  

\- \*\*Excessive animations\*\*: motion should clarify, not make you seasick.  

\- \*\*Pure color indicators\*\*: “green = success, red = error” without icons or text. Congrats, you’ve just excluded colorblind users.  

\- \*\*Tiny targets\*\*: if someone can’t tap it on a phone without zooming, you’ve designed a rage-click generator.  

\- \*\*Dark patterns\*\*: “unsubscribe” in white text on a white background. You might get short-term clicks, but long-term hatred.



---



\## What must be present (or everything breaks)

\- \*\*Clear hierarchy\*\*: what’s important, what’s secondary. Without it, users drown in noise.  

\- \*\*Feedback loops\*\*: click → response. Without feedback, people spam-click or assume your app is broken.  

\- \*\*Accessibility\*\*: alt text, focus rings, ARIA where needed. Without it, you lock out entire groups of people (and maybe get sued).  

\- \*\*Consistency\*\*: same patterns for same tasks. Without it, every screen feels like a new app.  

\- \*\*Undo/escape\*\*: without a way back, users don’t explore—they fear breaking things.

\## Fun/nice to have (not essential, but delightful)

\- \*\*Micro-interactions\*\*: a heart that pulses when you like something. Feedback plus personality.  

\- \*\*Skeleton screens/shimmer loaders\*\*: makes waiting feel intentional.  

\- \*\*Command palette / shortcuts\*\*: power-user candy.  

\- \*\*Dark mode toggle\*\*: half the internet cheers, half shrugs, but it never hurts.

\## Fun but can get annoying fast

\- \*\*Gamification\*\*: badges and confetti—cute once, exhausting on the 50th pop-up.  

\- \*\*Over-personalization\*\*: “Hi Brett, looks like you’re viewing this at 2:07 AM again 👀” …creepy, not cute.  

\- \*\*Whimsical copy\*\*: “Whoopsie-doodle, something borked!” Maybe funny once; irritating when you’re actually losing work.  

\- \*\*Easter eggs everywhere\*\*: hidden jokes and animations can delight, but if you’re hunting memes instead of features, it’s bad product design.

In short:  

Bad UI = noise, confusion, wasted time.  

Good UI = clarity, feedback, trust.  

Fun UI = sprinkles of delight.  

Annoying UI = sprinkles poured into your soup.
