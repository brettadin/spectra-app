# PATCH_NOTES v1.1.2b â€” Versioning & Patch Visibility
Date: 2025-09-19T20:30:37Z

## Summary
- Introduced `app/version.json` and loader `app/_version.py` to centralize versioning.
- Surfaced version and one-line summary in the UI and exports.
- Watermarked Plotly figures with the version string so screenshots are self-identifying.
- Added `scripts/print_version.py` for CI and human sanity.
- Established the dual-location rule for patch notes (root summary + docs/patches longform).
