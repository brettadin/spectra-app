# AI Handoff Prompt â€” v1.2.0e

## Snapshot
- Version: v1.2.0e (REF 1.2.0e-A01)
- Focus: Keep the Spectra App header aligned with live patch metadata and back it with regression coverage.

## Completed in this patch
1. Added `_render_app_header` so the main title/caption reuse `_resolve_patch_metadata` and stay in sync with the Docs tab banner.
2. Updated the app header caption to prefer the resolved patch version and formatted timestamp, eliminating the v0.0.0-dev drift.
3. Extended `tests/ui/test_docs_tab.py` with `test_header_prefers_patch_version` to assert the caption renders the patch version, timestamp, and summary.
4. Rolled continuity collateral: version bump, patch log, patch notes (md/txt), brains log/index, and AI activity log entry for v1.2.0e.

## Outstanding priorities
- Restore the documentation search tooling (FAISS + sentence transformers) mandated in `agents.md` so the RAG workflow can run instead of being documented as blocked.
- Audit other UI surfaces for lingering hard-coded version text and migrate them to `_resolve_patch_metadata` helpers.
- Expand Streamlit snapshot coverage so `_render_app_header` is exercised through the full `render()` flow once infrastructure allows.

## Suggested next steps
- Re-run regression suite including UI smoke tests once Streamlit snapshot tooling lands, ensuring header/Docs tab stay aligned.
- Continue the v1.2 backlog: SIMBAD resolver integration, ingestion queue refactor, provenance/export manifest enrichment.
- Coordinate with DevOps to package the updated patch notes + brains into the release artefacts.
