# AI Handoff Prompt â€” v1.2.0k

## Snapshot
- Version: v1.2.0k (REF 1.2.0k-A01)
- Focus: Streamline the target catalog experience with search controls, manifest summaries, and grouped overlay actions.

## Completed in this patch
1. Raised the target picker above the catalog table and introduced search + curated/planet filters so users can narrow long lists before loading manifests.
2. Rendered manifest metadata (autogenerated summary, curated counts, archive flags, coordinates) in a dedicated summary block immediately after the selection.
3. Grouped curated MAST spectra under a collection heading with an optional filter while keeping overlay eligibility messaging intact.
4. Added `tests/ui/test_targets_panel_layout.py` to assert the presence of search/filter controls, manifest metrics, and the new collection filter.
5. Bumped the app version to v1.2.0k and refreshed patch notes, brains, AI log entry, patch log, brains index, and this handoff brief.

## Outstanding priorities
- Continue the SIMBAD resolver + ingestion backlog from prior brains entries so the catalog search can graduate to live resolver-backed lookups.
- Restore the docs search/RAG tooling (faiss + sentence-transformers) noted in earlier handoff prompts to satisfy the AGENTS.md workflow.
- Monitor MAST manifest fields for richer collection/instrument metadata and revisit the grouping labels when the data improves.

## Suggested next steps
- Extend regression coverage so the new summary metrics stay visible when manifests omit `mast_summary` fields (add fixtures for no-MAST targets).
- Prototype a compact manifest fact sheet (program IDs, provider counts) that reuses the new summary container without crowding the overlay list.
- Re-run the full UI smoke suite once the resolver work lands to ensure the new layout cooperates with dynamic search results.
