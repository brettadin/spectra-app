Note

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` come from a Linux-centric
specification
(see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support)
for more details), but `astropy` will use them on any OS as a more
general means to know where user-specific configurations should be written.
