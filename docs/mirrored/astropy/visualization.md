## Introduction

[`astropy.visualization`](ref_api.html#module-astropy.visualization "astropy.visualization") provides functionality that can be helpful when
visualizing data. This includes a framework for plotting Astronomical images
with coordinates with Matplotlib (previously the standalone **wcsaxes**
package), functionality related to image normalization (including both scaling
and stretching), smart histogram plotting, RGB color image creation from
separate images, and custom plotting styles for Matplotlib.
