Once your custom DOI has been created or you have selected an existing DOI, you must add a statement similar to the below examples in the data, analysis, or acknowledgment section using the AASTeX \dataset markup. Where exactly you decide to cite the DOI will depend on your article. The important thing is to include it, so that readers can access the data you analyzed. Additional guidance for non-AAS journals is provided in the next question. For AAS journal authors, we recommend updating to the most recent version of [AASTeX](https://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex.html):

**Example 1 (Data Analysis section):**   
All the [mission] data used in this paper can be found in MAST: \dataset[https://doi.org/10.17909/######]{https://doi.org/10.17909/######}.

**Example 2 (Acknowledgments):**   
Some/all of the data presented in this paper were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at the Space Telescope Science Institute. The specific observations analyzed can be accessed via \dataset[https://doi.org/10.17909/######]{https://doi.org/10.17909/######}. STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5–26555. Support to MAST for these data is provided by the NASA Office of Space Science via grant NAG5–7584 and by other grants and contracts.

The DOI citation can be included with your manuscript at the time of submission or amended to your text file during the revision process. More information about the AASTeX \dataset command can be found [here](https://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex/aasguide.html#celestial_object).
