There are a number of software tools available to assist JWST users as they investigate various observing options for viability, and ultimately generate a proposal or program update for submission. This article provides a quick look overview of what is available.

*See also: Master list of [JWST Proposing Help videos on all topics](/proposal-planning-video-tutorials)  ![](/files/154687163/154687164/1/1737746591705/image2019-10-2_17-5-20.png)*

The primary JWST tools needed to support proposal writing include the [JWST Exposure Time Calculator](/jwst-exposure-time-calculator-overview) and the [Astronomer's Proposal Tool](/jwst-astronomer-s-proposal-tool-overview).  However, the JWST project supports a number of other specialized tools that can be great time-savers for those investigating special cases.  These tools typically are used to provide a quick look into parameters such as visibility, sensitivity, or variations in background levels as a function of time.

The following tool has been developed by external community members and is not supported directly by STScI. However, many in the broader community may find it useful and a link is provided for visibility and convenience.

* [MIRISIM](http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-planning/proposal-planning-toolbox/mirisim) can generate imaging, as well as low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic data simulations for MIRI. These simulated observations can help proposers better understand the capabilities of the instrument, prepare their own observations, and plan ahead for data analysis. MIRISIM was developed and is supported by the MIRI consortium.

Help for this tool is *not available* through the JWST Help Desk since the tool is managed outside of STScI.
