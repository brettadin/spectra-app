# Spectroscopy Overview



Spectroscopy is basically humanity’s nosy way of interrogating the universe. Instead of knocking on a star’s door and asking what it’s made of, we take the light it sends, smear it out into colors, and then obsess over the wiggles. It’s both poetry and spreadsheets at the same time. Here’s the deep dive:

\## Core Idea

\- \*\*Spectroscopy = splitting light\*\* into its component wavelengths (or frequencies, or wavenumbers).

\- \*\*Result\*\*: A spectrum (intensity vs. wavelength) that acts like a fingerprint of the source.

\## Flavors of Spectroscopy

1\. \*\*Absorption spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  White-ish light passes through something (gas, liquid, solid). Certain wavelengths are absorbed, leaving dips (Fraunhofer lines in the Sun, for example).

&nbsp;  

2\. \*\*Emission spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  Excited atoms/molecules dump energy as photons at discrete wavelengths. That’s how neon signs glow or why sodium lamps are that nasty yellow.



3\. \*\*Fluorescence / Raman spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Fluorescence: Absorb high-energy light, re-emit lower-energy light.  

&nbsp;  - Raman: Measure how light shifts when it scatters off molecular vibrations.



4\. \*\*Photoelectron spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  Kick out electrons with high-energy light, measure their energies → tells you about orbital energies.



5\. \*\*Infrared spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  Great for molecules: vibrational modes leave clear signatures. CO₂, H₂O, CH₄ all scream in IR.



6\. \*\*Ultraviolet/Visible spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  Excited electronic transitions, especially in atoms and conjugated molecules.



7\. \*\*X-ray spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  Probe deep core-level electrons, great for crystal structures (XRD) and elemental analysis.



8\. \*\*Radio / Microwave spectroscopy\*\*  

&nbsp;  Rotational transitions of molecules, masers, 21 cm hydrogen line.

\## What Spectroscopy Tells Us

\- \*\*Composition\*\*: What elements and molecules are present.  

\- \*\*Physical conditions\*\*: Temperature, density, pressure (line broadening, ratios).  

\- \*\*Motion\*\*: Doppler shifts → velocities.  

\- \*\*Magnetic fields\*\*: Zeeman splitting of spectral lines.  

\- \*\*Environment\*\*: Dust extinction, scattering, polarization.  

\- \*\*Structure\*\*: Vibrational/rotational energy levels for molecules.  

\- \*\*Time evolution\*\*: Variability and transient events.

\## How We Do It

\- \*\*Prisms \& Gratings\*\*: Split light into wavelengths.  

\- \*\*Interferometers (FTIR, Michelson)\*\*: Use interference to reconstruct spectra.  

\- \*\*Echelle spectrographs\*\*: High-resolution, stacked orders.  

\- \*\*Detectors\*\*: CCDs, CMOS, bolometers, photomultipliers.  

\- \*\*Data handling\*\*: Usually stored in FITS files with flux, wavelength, error, and metadata.

\## Astronomical Context

\- \*\*Stellar spectroscopy\*\*: Classify stars (OBAFGKM), measure metallicity, velocities.  

\- \*\*Exoplanets\*\*: Transmission spectroscopy during transits → sniff atmospheres for water, methane, etc.  

\- \*\*Cosmology\*\*: Redshift of galaxies → expansion of the universe.  

\- \*\*Laboratory links\*\*: NIST atomic spectra, HITRAN molecular lines for reference.

\## Data Treatment

\- \*\*Calibration\*\*: Lamps (Ne, Hg, Xe, etc.), flat fields, bias frames.  

\- \*\*Wavelength calibration\*\*: Match known lamp lines.  

\- \*\*Flux calibration\*\*: Compare to standard stars.  

\- \*\*Normalization\*\*: Flatten continuum to study line strengths.  

\- \*\*Archiving\*\*: FITS format, with headers storing every scrap of provenance (instrument, exposure, telescope, even the poor grad student’s initials if you’re unlucky).

\## Famous Spectral Milestones

\- \*\*Fraunhofer lines (1814)\*\*: First observed dark lines in solar spectrum.  

\- \*\*Balmer series (1885)\*\*: Formula for hydrogen’s visible lines.  

\- \*\*Bohr model (1913)\*\*: Explained hydrogen’s line structure.  

\- \*\*Hubble’s redshift (1929)\*\*: Galaxies racing away → expanding universe.  

\- \*\*Exoplanet atmospheres (2000s+)\*\*: Detecting sodium, water, CO₂ in alien skies.

\## Why It Matters

Spectroscopy is how we know:

\- The Sun has hydrogen and helium, not green cheese.  

\- The universe is expanding.  

\- Exoplanets might have water vapor.  

\- Your blood oxygen level in a hospital.  

\- What’s in that sketchy pill at the airport.  



It’s literally the Swiss Army knife of science.
