Spectra App â€” Patch Notes v1.1.5e
=================================
Release Date (UTC): 2025-09-22

## Highlights
- Fixed the ingestion resolution estimator so CSV/TXT/FITS uploads no longer
  raise shape mismatch errors when duplicate wavelength samples are present.
- Applied the guarded estimator to both ASCII and FITS pipelines so metadata
  captures `resolution_native` only when a valid resolving power can be derived.
- Updated continuity metadata (brains index/log, patch log, version file) to
  record the ingestion fix alongside the provenance/export tooling.

## Modules Touched
- `app/server/ingestion_pipeline.py`
- `PATCHLOG.txt`
- `app/version.json`
- `docs/brains/brains_INDEX.md`
- `docs/brains/brains_v1.1.5e.md`
- `docs/PATCH_NOTES/v1.1.5e.txt`

## Continuity Links
- Brains log: `docs/brains/brains_v1.1.5e.md`
- AI handoff bridge: `docs/brains/ai_handoff.md`
- Atlas index: `docs/atlas/index.md`

## Verification
- `pytest`
- Manual Streamlit upload smoke test focusing on duplicate wavelength samples

## Follow-up
- Add regression coverage for `_estimate_resolution` when ingestion receives
  uneven sampling or repeated wavelength values.
- Consider surfacing the derived `resolution_native` in the UI metadata table
  with explicit uncertainty messaging when the estimator falls back.
