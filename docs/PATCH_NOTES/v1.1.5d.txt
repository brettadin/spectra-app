Spectra App â€” Patch Notes v1.1.5d
=================================
Release Date (UTC): 2025-09-22

## Highlights
- Fixed runtime regressions by importing the `time` module for manifest exports
  and standard library dependencies for the duplicate upload ledger so Streamlit
  sessions can persist hashes and timestamps without errors.
- Refreshed the Docs tab to surface the Spectra Atlas pages with rendered
  markdown, automatic titles, and source captions alongside the legacy reference
  guides.
- Preserved export provenance by continuing to stamp manifests with UTC
  timestamps and wiring the updated ledger through the overlay export flow.
