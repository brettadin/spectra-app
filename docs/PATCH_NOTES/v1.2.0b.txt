Spectra App â€” Patch Notes v1.2.0b
=================================

Highlights
----------
- Teach FITS ingestion to treat TIME columns with BJD/MJD/second units as time-series axes instead of rejecting them as non-spectral data.
- Update overlay rendering and metadata summaries so time axes surface their native units/ranges alongside flux.
- Add regression coverage for light-curve ingestion and UI metadata formatting.

Verification
------------
- pytest tests/server/test_ingest_fits.py::test_parse_fits_accepts_time_series_units
- pytest tests/ui/test_metadata_summary.py
