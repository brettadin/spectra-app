v1.1.6b â€” Archive UX + solar reference groundwork (see PATCH_NOTES_v1.1.6b.md for full details).
- Collapse archive metadata/provenance into closed expanders so overlay actions stay visible.
- Drop the redundant overlay visibility column and rely on the sidebar multiselect for display control.
- Introduce a telescope-observed solar spectrum example with smoothed-default plotting, raw toggle, and band filters.
- Extend overlay unit semantics so emission/absorption data use unit-aware, per-axis rendering.
