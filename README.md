oh theres no readme in here wtf


well.
today is 10/1/25 ~11:30pm . This is, at least as far as this iteration of the application goes. v1.2.1b.
I've been working on this and other versions of this app for about a month now using only 'vibe coding'
In this time, I'm 100% certain I could have learned how to code this myself. But I really liked the idea of trading off with an ai, and I would do the bug fixing.
It was painful as hell. I can't lie. Lots of lost sleep. Lots of lost study time. Time with loved ones.
I really should have just learned how to code lol.
The idea is simple. Find credible spectral data from telescopes.
Match it up with user uploaded data, in the form of (for now) elemental lamp spectra collected via an Ocean Optics USB4000 Fiber Optic Spectrometer.
Pull in spectral lines from NIST to see atomic emission spectra, and how it aligns with stars as seen from telescopes and our lamp data.
Then I got carried away with bug fixing, and trying to tiddy up the UI/functionality of it. Lots of time spent getting to read files for data consistently.
Or trying to get data points plotted correctly.
Trying to get units right.. and converted...
Getting sources accounted for
documentation
making it learn/speak to itself and future versions of itself.
It was a lot of fun though
and im going to continue working on it slowly over time
but right now i think i have the core model of what i need to progress onto the next part of my stec 4800 (4300? idk)
Next *phase* is gas phase chromotography on Gaseous H2O, CO2 and CH4. in the lab. Gotta make the procedure for that, finish the write up for this.
Collect spectral data for the new lamps we ordered in the lab, H2O, CO, Hydrogen, H/He mix (star emulation lamp) and an air lamp.
I'm also going to continue to collect spectral data of the sun by hand at different times/days/conditions. 
Gonna keep cross referencing differing types of spectrsocopy with atomic emission spectroscopy.
Get ahold of raw exoplanet composition data, or spectroscopic data.
Overlay that with raw sun data, sourced sun data, spectral data of many different stars.
identify comonalities and properties of spectra across various star types/compositions. 
*basically use the differentiation tab to grab all the data from these stars/planets/collected spectra, and well.. see if we can easily predict the compositions of exoplanets*
If we analyze known types of planets/stars, and see how they interact, we can quickly classify/characterize planets *(if im doing this right, and im not crazy and just wasting time doing nothing of worth lol)*
And this should be the frist thing i say, but like. I'd rather speak as me first.
This should go without saying, i didn't code any of this.
This work was done by the chatgpt5 model, chatgpt codex, some of the agent. and i did the applications and shit i guess.
I cannot fully take credit for it, as I am only piggy backing off the work of others who designed the ai to do such tasks
and those who collected this data, sourced it themselves, uploaded it. 
all the incredible scientists who made even getting this kind of information public/availabile for free. 
the people who made python/all libs included and much much more.
im kinda ranting. but i wanted to leave a piece of me in here at least. 
and i swear to god, codex if you over write this readme then i'll switch to another ai model lol.





oh fuck this is gonna display on the front page isnt it lol. whatever.
If I forget to edit this before showing my teachers.. Whoops.
I'll clean it up. ðŸ¤£
