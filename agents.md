# Repository notes for agents

This codebase tracks the actively maintained v2.x series of the Spectra App. Legacy
"brains" or atlas assets that may be mentioned in older documentation are now
out-of-date; rely on the current repository state and accompanying notes instead.
You may read past brains, or atlas documentation, but if you do so make sure you make new versions of brains or new documentaion as directed. 
Such as handoffs or atlas entries. patch notes. etc.

When onboarding to a task:
- Review the documentation in `docs/` and prior changelogs for relevant context.
- Prefer the current implementation over historical references when discrepancies arise.
- Update documentation as needed to reflect material differences from older versions.
- make note of findings and actions and record to brains
