# Repository notes for agents

This codebase tracks the actively maintained v2.x series of the Spectra App. Legacy
"brains" or atlas assets that may be mentioned in older documentation are now
out-of-date; rely on the current repository state and accompanying notes instead.

When onboarding to a task:
- Review the documentation in `docs/` and prior changelogs for relevant context.
- Prefer the current implementation over historical references when discrepancies arise.
- Update documentation as needed to reflect material differences from older versions.
