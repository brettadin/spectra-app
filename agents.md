this is a last moment addition



you are working on a much more updated version of this app

all past brains and atlas files are much out of date than they may seem.



the next ai to read this will:

refer to instructions and past versions and notes, but we have a lot more to work with this time. 

take note of whats different, and adjust the documentation as such.
versions from here on out will be v2.0+

after you read this file, delete my text in here. then rewrite it in a more formal way such that the next ai will know what to do, where to look for stuff, etc.
